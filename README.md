# Deliverables 🚚... Une image vaut mieux qu'un long discours 😉

1. **Use case diagrams**

Use case diagrams for each of the major features/page (login, chat, calendar, task manager, dashboard), no need to use UML.

2. **User stories with requirements**

User stories with requirements for each feature, shared in a standard format (PDF, DOCX, XLSX).

3. **Mock-ups**

Mock-ups of the site with a simple design and at least one mock-up per page (you can use Figma or Sketch and you will have to explain the navigation between the pages during the meeting).

4. **Kanban**

A Kanban breaking down the project, in a macro way (technical details excluded) into blocks of features and sub-features for development. I have started the breakdown in this kanban on [notion](https://learnathome-p10.notion.site/), it's up to you to complete the "ANALYZE" column on the same model. You can work on Notion, Trello or GitHub.
